You should also download the `gnome-extensions-app` application so that you can see and modify all extensions, including manually installed ones. Each time you install one manually though you will have to restart gnome with either `Alt + F2` or rebooting your machine.

## Manual Install
For the ones that can't just be added using the [gnome extensions website](<https://extensions.gnome.org>)
### [Hanabi](<https://github.com/jeffshee/gnome-ext-hanabi>)
Animated background wallpaper player that uses javascript, can be installed with:
```bash
# Make sure you have the meson package installed
git clone https://github.com/jeffshee/gnome-ext-hanabi.git

cd gnome-ext-hanabi/

sudo apt install meson
./run install
```
It is recommended to configure what video that you want to play with `gnome-extensions` but you can also do it with this command, (this will play the video over all other apps though, may need to figure out how to put it in the back):
```bash
gjs /home/pizza2d1/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/hanabi-extension@jeffshee.github.io/renderer/renderer.js -P /home/pizza2d1/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/hanabi-extension@jeffshee.github.io -F [PATH_TO VIDEO_FILE] # ADD ABSOLUTE PATH
```
