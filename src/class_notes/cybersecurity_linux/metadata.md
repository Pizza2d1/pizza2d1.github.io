Cybersecurity Linux Lesson 1.2.3

___
### Metadata  
Users will learn how data is cataloged in most Linux  
systems.
- Linux uses metadata to help us understand the differences between files of the same type  
- Some examples include:  
	- The title, artist, and album of a song in an .mp3  
	- The creation data, file size, and resolution of a photo in a .jpg  
	- The GPS coordinates of a geotagged image.  
	- The hashtags associated with a social media post.  
	- The keywords used to describe a website.

### Metadata - Example  
Picture yourself in a library looking for a book about dinosaurs, looking up and down every aisle until you finally find it.  
• Instead, you could search the catalog for “dinosaurs”  
• The catalog is database of information about books containing:  
	• Titles  
	• Authors  
	• Subjects  
	• And more

### Metadata - Commands  
**<span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">stat</span>**
• Prints out the status of Linux files, directories, and file systems  
• Includes information regarding files, directories and file systems such as their sizes, blocks, inodes, permissions, and timestamps for modification

**<span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">file</span>**  
• Determines the file type, ignoring the extension used for file  
• Different extensions can be used on a file either accidently or maliciously
