# Application Security
Cybersecurity Forensics Lesson 4.1.4

___
### Application Security
- Measures and practices to protect applications from security threats.
- **Key Aspects**:  
	1. Input Validation  
	2. Secure Cookies  
	3. Static Code Analysis  
	4. Code Signing
- **Importance**: Enhancing resilience against cyber threats throughout the development lifecycle.

### Input Validation
- Checking and validating user inputs to prevent vulnerabilities.
- **Importance**: Mitigating risks of SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and input-based attacks.
- **Implementation**: Enforce strict validation rules and sanitize user inputs.

### Secure Cookies
- Enhancing data security by transmitting cookies over HTTPS.
- **Importance**: Preventing interception of sensitive data.
- **Implementation**: Mark cookies as “secure” to ensure encrypted transmission.

### Static Code Analysis
- Reviewing source code for security vulnerabilities without execution.
- **Importance**: Identifying code errors and weaknesses during development.
- **Implementation**: Use automated tools for comprehensive code analysis.

### Code Signing
- Digitally signing software code to confirm integrity and authenticity.
- **Importance**: Verifying source and preventing tampering.
- **Implementation**: Employ code signing in software distribution processes.

### Sandboxing
- Isolating running programs to prevent harm or unauthorized access.
- The term is derived from the idea of a child’s sandbox where play is constrained to a confined area.
- **Implementation**: Restricting access to system resources, networks, and data.
- **Importance**:  
	1. Preventing malicious actions  
	2. Limiting impact of security breaches  
	3. Controlling resource usage  
	4. Restricting network access  
	5. Protecting file system integrity

### Monitoring
- Observing and tracking system, network, and application performance and security.
- **Goals**: Detecting issues, ensuring availability, responding to security threats.
- Components: Data collection, analysis, alerting, and performance tracking.

### Security Monitoring
- **Importance**: Detecting and responding to security threats.
- Activities: Log analysis, anomaly detection, incident response.
- **Goal**: Timely identification and mitigation of security incidents.

### Performance Monitoring
- **Importance**: Optimizing resource utilization and identifying bottlenecks.
- Metrics: CPU usage, memory consumption, disk I/O, network latency.
- **Goal**: Enhancing system performance and scalability.

### Availability Monitoring
- **Importance**: Ensuring systems and services are available and responsive.
- Metrics: Uptime, response time, service availability.
- **Goal**: Maintaining service continuity and minimizing downtime.

### Log Analysis
- **Importance**: Troubleshooting, error identification, event sequence understanding.
- **Usage**: Analyzing logs for patterns, trends, and anomalies.
- **Goal**: Facilitating proactive management and resource planning.
