# Social Engineering
Cybersecurity Forensics Lesson 2.2.2

___
### Social Engineering  
• Using social interactions, such as relationships, persuasion, and body language, to gain access to secretive or personal information or persuade someone to perform an action.  
• Can be a single person or a group working together  
• Can be performed in-person or though technical means such as texting, email, and social media

### Principles of Social Engineering  
• <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Authority</span>  
	• The malicious actor acts as an authority figure to gain information  
		• _“Don’t you know who I am?!”_ 
		• _“This is the police!”_  
• <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Intimidation</span>  
	• Exploits fear, usually with the idea that there are repercussions if you do not comply, or if you don’t help, bad things happen.  
• <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Consensus/Social proof</span>  
	• Make it seem routine or as if everyone is performing the action  
		• _“This isn’t the first time we’ve done this.”_
		• _“Jose in IT did this for me last time.”_

### Principles of Social Engineering  
• <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Scarcity</span>  
	• Limited time to decide or a limited opportunity to get a prize or have a task completed  
• <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Urgency</span>  
	• You must act now with no time to think about the outcome  
• <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Familiarity/Liking</span>  
	• Someone you know, we have common friends  
		• _“John put me in touch with you”_  
• <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Trust</span>  
	• Someone who is safe or is simply performing their duty  
		• _“I’m from IT. I’m being helpful. Let me help you.”_

### Defending Against Social Engineering  
• Look for the principles discussed or warning signs:  
	• Authority  
	• Intimidation  
	• Consensus/ Social Proof  
	• Scarcity  
	• Urgency  
	• Familiarity/ Liking  
	• Trust  
• Recognizing key words and phrases such as “Act now”, “Supplies are limited”, “You were chosen as a winner” etc. are all potential clues to a social engineering attack.
