3. Evaluates the risk of reoffending
    
4. Provided counseling and other services to inmates and offenders
  
#### Forensic: (Legal system)

2. Evaluates if defendants are competent to stand trail
    
3. Makes sentencing recommendations
    
4. Gives testimony as an expert


## FBI Profiling Process

### 1. Data Assimilation:

Collect data from police reports, witness reports, and from crime scene

Signature - Something done to fulfill or satisfy the offender’s emotional state

(Not the same as Modus Operandi)

#### Modus Operandi
What is needed to complete the crime

##### State of the crime scene
Gives clues about the type of offender
- ###### Age
    
- ###### Race
    
- ###### Motive

### 2. Crime Classification
Profilers decide whether the crime scene is organized or disorganized (planned)

##### Organized crime scene:
- Body is hidden
- Weapon is removed from scene
- Appears well-planned
- The victim is specifically targeted
- Restraint often used
- Aggression takes place before death
###### Organized crime scene suggests an offender
- Average or above average IQ
- Employed, usually quite skilled
- Socially competent
- Uses alcohol in commision of crime
- Uses car to drive to crime scene/hunt for victim
- Obsessed with media coverage of his crimes

##### Disorganized crime scene:
- Body not hidden
- Weapon is present
- Appears to be spontaneous
- Victim may be an acquaintance
- Aggression post-mortem
###### Disorganized crime scene suggests an offender:
- Below average IQ
- Unstable employment record, unskilled
- Socially isolated
- Lives close to crime scene
- Strict discipline as a child
- Extremely anxious


### 3. Crime Reconstruction:
Hypothesis about crime sequence, offender and victim behaviour

### 4. Profile Generation:
Offender’s physical demographic and behavioural characteristics
