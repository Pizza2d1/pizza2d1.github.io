# Memory

___
## Definition:
The persistence of learning over time through the encoding, storage, and retrieval, of information

### Alzheimerâ€™s Disease:
Protein that builds up in the brain and causes neurons to die

## How our brains MAKE memories:

- An external event causes sensory input
    
- That sensory input is converted into neural information via transduction
    
- This current, or very recent, experiences are stored as sensory memory
    
- That sensory memory is encoded
    
- #### Encoding: Whatever you do to make you remember
	
	- This encoded information goes into short term memory
    
- #### Short Term Memory: Memories that we use everyday, also known as our working memory
    
	- Short term memory is then further encoded in to long term memory
    
- #### Long Term Memory: All memories we use when needed
    
	- When long term memory is needed, is is retrieved into short term memory for us to use
  

### Recall:
A measure of memory in which the person must retrieve information learned earlier, as on a fill in the blank test
### Recognition:
A measure of memory in which the person identifies items previously learned, as on a multiple-choice test
### Relearning:
Remembering what someone is saying after they explain it
