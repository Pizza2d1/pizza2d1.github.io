# Conversion Disorder

Conversion disorder, also known as functional neurological symptom disorder, is rare and only affects around 4 to 12 people out of every 100,000 which is almost 60 times more rare than getting cancer. This disorder has shown to mainly affect the body’s nervous system and causes differing effects from person to person as it usually is in combination with some other disorders which can affect the person’s senses and cause them to have muscle spasms. The parts of your brain that are affected are the prefrontal cortex and motor cortex having an increase in activity, while the hippocampus has a lower activity. Episodes that you get from it are usually in the form of muscle spasms, twitching, sensory flashes, and numbness. But what causes conversion disorder? Many people who develop it get it as a cause of psychological trauma, such as guilt for something that you did, or large amounts of stress that cause you to start losing control of your body.

In order to treat this disorder, we have multiple different kinds of therapies to try, the most recommended one is a psychotherapy called CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy), this type is the most common to treat it and is also the most likely to work. Second is hypnotherapy, also known as hypnosis, which can  help relax and destress the person being affected by conversion disorder. And finally, family and group therapy, which can help the people around them understand what is happening and also to give them an outlet to hopefully give the person with the disorder relief.

Conversion disorder will make you feel like you don’t have control over your body, making you feel more stressed and sometimes angry

###### What sully would say

“Sorry you're going through that have you looked into therapists or physical therapists. And inside your brain is being disrupted by trauma you may have gone through and your neurons are now misfiring. Conversion disorder is when trauma or other mental illnesses like anxiety can affect your physical body and can make you have paralysis. You can also tell if you're having an episode if you lose sense in your limbs or stop moving if that happens seek a doctor cause then they could help. You can treat it by going to a therapist because your disorder is caused by other mental illnesses and if you see a therapist they can help you process it and you can start feeling normal again cause this illness is very curable so that's good! And sorry if your feeling dizzy or weak because that is sadly what comes from conversion disorder. To help control it you can go to therapists and take meds to help it.”
