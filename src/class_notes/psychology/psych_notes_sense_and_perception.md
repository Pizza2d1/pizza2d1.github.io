# Sense and Perception

___
## Sense:
The process by which our sensory receptors and nervous system receive and represent stimulus energies from our environment

#### Vestibular Sense:
Your sense of whole body balance and equilibrium (governed mostly in the semicircular canals in the inner ear, but also in the Cerebellum, in the oldest part of the brain.
#### Kinesthetic Sense:
Your sense of body part position and movement (the receptors for this are all over the skin)
#### Sensory Receptors:
Sensory nerve endings that responds to stimuli


## Perception:
The process by which out brain organizes and interprets sensory information, enabling us to recognize objects and events as meaningful

#### Bottom-up processing:
Information processing that begins with the sensory receptors and works up to the brain’s integration of sensory information
#### Top-down processing:
Information processing guided by higher-level mental processes
#### Weber’s Law:
The intensity of the just noticeable difference depends on how large the stimulus is to begin with


## HEARING:
- Like other senses, our hearing or audition, helps us adapt and survive
- Hearing provides information and enables relationships

### How it works:
- Air molecules, each bumping into the next, create waves of compressed and expanded air, like the ripples on a pond circling out from a tossed river
- As we swim in our ocean of moving air molecules, our ears detect these brief air pauses

### Sound waves:
- Frequency: The number of complete wavelengths that pass a point in a given time
- Pitch: A tone’s experienced highness or lowness; depends on frequency

### Ear hair:
- Ear hair is what converts sound waves into electrical impulses (transduction) in the cochlea
- Eventually thin/fall out due to age, same way hair off the top of the head falls off


### Selective Attention:
- Focusing conscious awareness on a particular stimulus to the exclusion of others

### Inattentional blindness:
- The inability to see an object or a person in out mindset
  

## SEEING

#### Electromagnetic energy
- When you look at a bright red tulip, the stimuli striking your eyes are not particles of the color red, but pulses of electromagnetic energy that your visual system perceives as red
    
- On the other end are the mile-long waves of radio transmission
    
- In between is the narrow band visible to us. Other portions are visible to other animals
    
- What we see as a visible light is but a thing slice of the wide spectrum of electromagnetic energy. On the spectrum’s one end are the short gamma waves, no longer than the diameter of an atom
#### Wavelength and Hue
- Light travels in waves, and the shape of those waves influences what we see. Light’s wavelength is the distance from one wave peak to the next
    
- More narrow sound waves are cooler colors like blue, while longer wavelengths are hotter colors like red
    
- A light wave’s amplitude, or height determines its intensity-the amount of energy your eye receives

### The Eye
- Light enters the eye though the cornea, which bends light to help provide focus
    
- #### Cornea
	- The eye’s clear, protective, other later covering the pupil and iris
    
	- Light then passes through the pupil, a small adjustable opening
- #### Pupil
	- The adjustable opening in the center of your eye through which light enters
    
	- Surrounding the pupil and controlling its size is the iris, a colored muscle that dilates or constricts in response to light intensity
    
	- Each iris is so distinctive that an iris-scanning machine can confirm your identity
- #### Iris
	- ring of muscle tissue that forms the colored portion of the eye round the pupil and controls the size of the pupil opening
    
	- After passing through your pupil, light hits the transparent lens in your eye. The lens then focuses the light rays into an image on your retina
    
	- Lens: the transparent structure behind the pupil that changes shape to help focus images in the retina
    
	- Retina, a multi-layered tissue on the eyeball’s sensitive inner surface. To focus the rays, the lens changes its curvature and thickness in a process called accommodation
- #### Retina
	- The light-sensitive inner surface of the eye, containing the receptor rods and cones plus layers of neurons that begin the profession of visual information
- #### Rods
	- Retinal receptors that detect black, white, and gray, and are sensitive to movement; necessary for peripheral and twilight vision, when cones don’t respond
- #### Cones
	- Retinal receptors that are concentrated near the center of the retina and that function in daylight or in well-lit conditions
    
	- Cones detect fine detail and give rise to color sensations
    
	- The rods and cones trigger chemical changes
    
	- That chemical reaction would spark neural signals in nearby bipolar cells
    
	- You could then watch the bipolar cells activate neighboring ganglion cells, whose axons twine together like the strands of a tope to form the optic nerve
- #### Optic Nerve
	- The nerve that carries neural impulses from the eye to the brain
  

## TASTE:

- Taste is a chemical sense
    
- Your brain does not taste, your tongue does
    
- Taste buds
    
- Your taste buds detect 5 tastes: sweet, bitter, umomi, sour, and salty
    
- Papillae holds the taste bud
    
- Gustatory nerves connect your taste buds to the spine
    
- Processing is done in the frontal lobe (memory)


### Why do we love salty and sweet and dislike bitter and sour:

- #### Sweet
	- Our mothers milk is sweet, So sweet is the first taste we are given in life. So we crave it early on.
- #### Salt
	- Is essential for our survival
- #### Bitter
	- Most things out in the world that are poisonous to the human body taste bitter
- #### Sour
	- Detecting unripe/unsafe food
  

## SMELL:
### Olfactory Cells
- Neurons that project from the brain that process odor molecules

## TOUCH:

- The sensation produced by contact of an object with the surface of the skin
    
- Sensitivity to touch varies in different parts of the body; For example, the lips and fingers are far more sensitive than the torso or back. See also touch sense
    
- It is our physical connection to the outside world
    
- Your skin is embedded with receptors that respond to various kinds of stimulation
    
- The basic touch senses are:
	- #### Pain
	    
	- #### Pressure
	    
	- #### Texture
	    
	- #### Temperature

#### Somatosensory Cortex:
- Front of the parietal lobe

### Three Types of Pain:

- #### Biological
	Sensory receptors called nociceptors - mostly in your skin, but also in your muscles and organ - detect hurtful temperatures, pressure, or chemicals
    

- #### Psychological
	- One powerful influence on out perception of pain is the attention we focus on it
	    
	- #### Cultural Influences
		- Pain is a product of our attention, our expectations, and also our culture
		    
		- Not surprisingly, then, our perception of pain varies with out social situation and out cultural traditions
		    
		- We tend to perceive more pain when others seem to be experiencing again
