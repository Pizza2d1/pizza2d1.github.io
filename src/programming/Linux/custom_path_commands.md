Custom $PATH files that I've made (In case I need to delete them):

THESE ARE ALL IN /usr/custom_paths/

###### asdf
Changes wallpaper to base Ubuntu wallpaper: 
`/usr/share/backgrounds/warty-final-ubuntu.png`

###### autocomp_maker
Makes a file that allows a custom command to have auto-completion when you use tab, just like with regular commands. Places the file in `/etc/bash_completion.d/`
source: [stackoverflow](<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44441249/how-to-autocomplete-a-bash-commandline-with-file-paths>)

###### bash_testing
Displays default terminal message, used for testing new `.bashrc` iterations and in case I want to display it without opening a new terminal window (I think its annoying)

###### bootselector
A tool I made that lets you switch your plymouth boot splash screen and add a plymouth to the list of available plymouths

###### boottester
Only kind of works, shows startup plymouth

###### gayshit
ASCII art of some gay shit
###### gayterm
Displays term but with too much color

###### ihaveawunkus
Will rotate through all of my goofy cat pictures

###### kermit
Displays kermit the frog with same computer spec details as term

###### pizzapaper
My wallpaper switching command that is made for gnome DE's

###### term
Shows the current `.bashrc` terminal opening display
