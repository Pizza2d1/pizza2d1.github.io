### About
In my AP Computer Science Priciples class we were able to do whatever project that we want, so I decided to make a wallpaper switcher using `gsettings` for my ubuntu laptop, since I had just barely started learning about bash scripting. I then kept working on it later, and when I switched to [Arch](https://archlinux.org) I added [swww](https://github.com/LGFae/swww) support for my hyprland DE.

### Plans
- Add support for other wallpaper managers besides just gnome's gsettings and wayland
- Add gui selector for wallpapers, rather than just being CLI
- Fix settings command for swww users
