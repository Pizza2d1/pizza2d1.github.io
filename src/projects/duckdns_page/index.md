### About
I wanted to make a cool website using php, so I started working on it and then found out about [neocities](https://neocities.org) and wanted to be as creative as some of the people that I saw. But as of now its bland, as I'm going to try and add content first and then style it later.

### Plans
- Finish adding basic content that is shown in the navbar
- Add a file convertion page that uses ffmpeg as a free service
- Theme the website while still having a low [carbon footprint](https://www.websitecarbon.com)
- Get the website to 80% - 100% on [internet.nl](https://internet.nl/site/pizza2d1.duckdns.org/3477257)
