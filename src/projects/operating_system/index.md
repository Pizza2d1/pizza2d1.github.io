### About
A while back I watched a video about [OsakaOS](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdJTmEZjUpt0JZIg6a_WLFvN-7RLsfMdx) and got inspired to start working on my own because I realized that embedded systems and low-level programming is actually pretty interesting. So I watched a few videos, and read through the [OSdev](https://osdev.org) guide to make a [bare bones](https://wiki.osdev.org/Bare_Bones) operating system that just prints out text

### Plans
What I want is to be able to create a working operating system that has:
- Simple networking for TCP and UDP support
- Working filesystem (most likely FAT styled)
- Basic scripting language to:
    - Read/Write files
    - Be able to sort files
    - Print text (include sed)
- a GUI if I get REALLY into this
