{: .warning }
> This was made in a very scrappy manner and may have some issues with it. If you see any, please help me and [make a issue notice](https://github.com/Pizza2d1/pizza2d1.github.io/issues/new) so that I can fix it. Thank you!

## Getting started

{: .note }
To use the theme, you do ***not*** need to clone or fork the [Just the Docs repo]! You should do that only if you intend to browse the theme docs locally, contribute to the development of the theme, or develop a new theme based on Just the Docs.

### License

If you would like to make a copy of this webpage for your own use, I recommend using the official [just-the-docs template](https://just-the-docs.github.io/just-the-docs-template/) which includes a valid MIT license, but if you would like to use mine that is totally, and completely fine (and would make me so happy)
#### [My license](https://github.com/pizza2d1/pizza2d1.github.io/tree/main/LICENSE.txt).

### Contributing

I would love to have some help adding new guides and notes, so if you yourself would like to add some, you can message me on [Discord](https://discordapp.com/users/714918826831118436), (Just make sure to tell me who you are first)
