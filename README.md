# Pizza2d1's Webpage
I made this webpage off the template that was provided by the [just-the-docs repository](https://github.com/just-the-docs/just-the-docs-template)

## Purpose
I wanted to make this webpage so that I could easily share notes and guides that I've made these past few months and so that I can get better at using both HTML and markdown
